# **Ralteen Fiel's Dream: A Journey Through the Mind**  

**Ralteen Fiel's Dream** is an interactive narrative that takes players deep into the world of dreams, where reality fades, and mystery unfolds. Trapped in an eternal slumber, **Ms. Ralteen Fiel** awaits those who dare to navigate the mystical rooms of her subconscious.  

## **Your Mission**  
To awaken Ralteen, you must uncover the **11 Words of Life (WOLs)**—hidden within the dark, whispering trees that speak eternal truths. Each room you enter will test your perception, intuition, and understanding of these cryptic messages.  

## **The Three Stages**  

- 🖤 **Dark Room** – A place of total obscurity, where ancient trees whisper lost wisdom, and WOLs lie in wait.  
- 🌙 **Moon Room** – A celestial realm where the stars illuminate hidden truths and the moonlight reveals what was once unseen.  
- ⚖️ **Judgement Room** – The final trial, where you must unscramble the collected Words of Life to break Ralteen’s endless slumber.  

## **About the Project**  
This project is a creative exploration of **interactive storytelling** and **web development**, designed by **James Phillip De Guzman**.
