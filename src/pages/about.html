                <h1>About the Adventure Game</h1>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> James Phillip De Guzman</p>
                <p><strong>Project Milestone:</strong> Adventure Game</p>
                <p><strong>Game Web App:</strong> Based on ralteenfiel2.py (version 2)</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Ralteen Fiel's Story</h2>
                <p>The game is based on a real adventure game I created during my mission, played by the Kiwalan Ward in
                    Iligan, Philippines. This Python adaptation follows the journey of Ms. Ralteen Fiel, who is lost in
                    her
                    dreams. Participants must find 11 Words of Life (WOLs) to unlock the riddle that binds her.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Participants begin in the Dark Room, blindfolded, and must find WOLs by engaging with individuals
                    dressed
                    as trees. They must ask, "Are you a Word of Life (WOL)?" and correctly guess the keyword from
                    scripture
                    verses provided. The challenge includes a math game and strategic choices like using a flashlight, a
                    guide, or collecting candy (which can lead to an early game-over).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Progressing Through the Game</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stars Room:</strong> A resting space after collecting all 11 WOLs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moon Room:</strong> Entered by reciting 3 Nephi 14:7 from the Book of Mormon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Judgment Room:</strong> Participants unscramble clues to form a final word.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sun Room:</strong> The ultimate reward for completing the game, featuring light, joy,
                        and a
                        message from Matthew 25:21.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h2>The Final Challenge</h2>
                <p>In the Judgment Room, participants must solve a puzzle: "I perish not, but is infinite..." within 3
                    minutes. Those who succeed enter the Sun Room, celebrating with friends, leaders, and a jar full of
                    cookies.</p>
